"# Ursula" 

Hi, I'm Ursula, a simple Discord bot created to help the development team where my creator works.
Commands I know:
* _!kep_ - post a random meme (general or development related)
* _!pr_ - List pull requests from the last bamboo build.

I can do this only if you create a file named ".env" in my directory. 
Please insert the following content to the file and specify the values after '='.

```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DOWNLOAD_URL=
DOWNLOAD_FILENAME=
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=
BAMBOO_URL=
BAMBOO_USERNAME=
BAMBOO_PASSWORD=
BAMBOO_PROJECT=
BAMBOO_PLAN=
BAMBOO_ARTIFACT=
```
